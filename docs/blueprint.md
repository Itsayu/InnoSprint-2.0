## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blood Red (#B71C1C) to evoke the game's intense atmosphere.
- Background color: Dark, desaturated gray (#212121) for dark theme, and light gray (#F5F5F5) for light theme.
- Accent color: Antique Gold (#FFD700) to highlight important elements and CTAs, providing a sense of Norse mythology richness.
- Font: 'Cinzel', serif. This font, which is already used in the app, suits the aesthetic perfectly and can continue to be used.
- Custom icons inspired by Norse mythology and the 'God of War' universe, for key UI elements and actions.
- Use a full-screen layout with a background canvas for animations, a fixed header, and a flexible content area.
- Subtle transitions and animations on page load, theme switch, and hover interactions, inspired by the visual effects in 'God of War'.
